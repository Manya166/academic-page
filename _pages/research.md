**Abstract:** I examine the effect of increased access to financial services on girls’ education
through the lens of a 2005 bank expansion policy in India. The policy provided exogenous
variation in bank availability by incentivizing private banks to make inroads
into the under-served areas. Labeled as "underbanked", these areas had a population
to bank branch ratio greater than the national average. Using a regression discontinuity
framework, I find that ten years after the policy, girls in underbanked districts
are 3 to 8 percent more likely to be enrolled in school in comparison to girls in nonunderbanked
districts. The effects vary across age groups, with stronger impacts observed
for adolescent girls. I identify higher savings and an income effect as potential
channels driving increased enrollment for girls. Additionally, improved labor market
outcomes for lower-caste groups suggest that economically and historically disadvantaged
households could be driving these results.

**Abstract:** Policy makers need access to reliable data to monitor and evaluate the progress of development outcomes and targets such as sustainable development outcomes (SDGs). However, significant data and evidence gaps remain. Lack of resources, limited capacity within governments and logistical difficulties in collecting data are some of the reasons for the data gaps. Big data—that is digitally generated, passively produced and automatically collected—offers a great potential for answering some of the data needs. Satellite and sensors, mobile phone call detail records, online transactions and search data, and social media are some of the examples of big data. Integrating big data with the traditional household surveys and administrative data can complement data availability, quality, granularity, accuracy and frequency, and help measure development outcomes temporally and spatially in a number of new ways.The study maps different sources of big data onto development outcomes (based on SDGs) to identify current evidence base, use and the gaps. The map provides a visual overview of existing and ongoing studies. This study also discusses the risks, biases and ethical challenges in using big data for measuring and evaluating development outcomes. The study is a valuable resource for evaluators, researchers, funders, policymakers and practitioners in their effort to contributing to evidence informed policy making and in achieving the SDGs.

The Value of Health : Global Estimates from a Health-Augmented Lifecycle Model
------
*with: JP Sevilla, Maddalena Ferranna, Leo Zucker and David Bloom*

**Abstract:** The economic evaluation of health technologies such as vaccines often relies on the principle that “a QALY is a QALY is a QALY”, i.e., any additional quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) brought about by the intervention has equal value across the population independently of the characteristics of the individual enjoying the health improvement. Although such a principle is defendable on equity grounds, it hinders the empirical evidence that health improvements do have differential impacts across the population, depending, e.g., on age, disability status, earnings, or financial risk. The objective of the paper is to provide country- and age-specific monetary estimates of the value of reductions in individual mortality and morbidity risks through a modeling approach. Based on the health-augmented lifecycle model popularized by Murphy and Topel (2006), we derive expressions for individual age-specific willingness-to-pay for reductions in mortality and morbidity risks. In particular, we derive age-specific expressions for value-per-statistical-life-year (VSLY) to evaluate changes in mortality risks, and value-per-statistical-disability (VSD) to evaluate changes in morbidity risks. We show that the VSLY/VSD measures depend, among other things, on age-specific profiles of consumption, income, wages, and time spent on leisure and nonmarket productive activities (e.g., childcare or volunteering). We then calibrate the VSLY/VSD measures using country- and age-specific data on consumption, income, wage, and time uses. Results from the paper can be used in the evaluation of health interventions around the world.

Social Emotional Learning and Educational Outcomes : Impact of Happiness Curriculum in public schools in India
------

**Abstract:** In 2019, Happiness Curriculum was launched by the government in Uttarakhand, a state located in northern part of India. With heavy emphasis on holistic development and critical thinking, this curriculum has gained immense popularity and is becoming a model that other states in India are planning to replicate. This paper investigates potential downstream effects of these investments, in terms of enrolment and learning outcomes. Does the introduction of this curriculum lead to improvement in academic learning? Does increased participation in classroom and better relationship with teachers motivate students to attend school? To answer these questions, I exploit the variation in treatment across different cohorts and states.
